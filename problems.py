'''
1. Fraud Detection (Highly Imbalanced, Noisy Data)
Dataset: Financial transactions (1% fraud, 99% normal).
Challenge:

Train a model to detect fraudulent transactions with high recall while minimizing false positives.
Use techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN, and cost-sensitive learning.
Tune thresholds to maximize F1-score.
''' 
'''
2. Medical Diagnosis (Rare Disease Prediction)
Dataset: Medical records (0.5% rare disease, 99.5% healthy).
Challenge:

Handle extreme class imbalance without overfitting.
Train models using ensemble methods and meta-learning.
Optimize for precision-recall AUC instead of accuracy.
